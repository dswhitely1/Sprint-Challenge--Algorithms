#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n^3) --- Reason being is that the While loop will run till A > n^3.  It will be quicker while n is small but grow in time as N gets larger


b)  O(log n) --- Reason is that j doubles with each pass multiplying itself by 2 with each pass.  


c)  O(n) --- Reason is that the recursion will loop n times.

## Exercise II

n - floor

Loop through floors until an egg is broken.
return the floor - 1 to get the floor where eggs are safe.

The run time complexity of this would be O(n) as we will need to loop through the floors till we find the optimal floor.
