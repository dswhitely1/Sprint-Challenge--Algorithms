#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n^3) --- Reason being is that the While loop will run till A > n^3.  It will be quicker while n is small but grow in time as N gets larger


b)  O(log n) --- Reason is that j doubles with each pass multiplying itself by 2 with each pass.  


c)  O(n) --- Reason is that the recursion will loop n times.
